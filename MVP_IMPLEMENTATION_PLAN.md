# Meeple Cart MVP Implementation Plan

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Target Launch:** 3 weeks from now
**Status:** Ready to implement

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Current State:** 70% complete - All infrastructure, database schema, and supporting features done
**Blocking Issue:** Core trade workflow incomplete - users can't formalize trades
**Time to MVP:** 3 weeks of focused development
**Risk Level:** Low - all hard problems solved, just need UI/workflow implementation

---

## 📋 What We Have vs What We Need

### ✅ Working Now (No Touch Needed)
- Authentication & user profiles
- Multi-game listing creation/management
- Private messaging system
- Gift cascade system (fully functional)
- Watchlist functionality
- Notifications infrastructure
- Database schema (100% complete)
- Dark/light theme system

### ❌ Critical Missing Pieces (MVP Blockers)
1. **Trade initiation flow** - No button/form to start a trade
2. **Trade detail page** - Exists but incomplete, needs status management
3. **Trade completion workflow** - No way to mark trades complete
4. **Feedback system** - Can't leave ratings/reviews
5. **Vouch granting** - Can't vouch for trading partners
6. **Browse/search pages** - Removed during merge, need client-side rebuild

---

## 🎬 Post-Launch (Week 4+)

### Immediate Priorities
1. Monitor for bugs and user feedback
2. Add analytics (user signups, listings created, trades completed)
3. Implement basic moderation tools
4. Set up automated backups

### Next Features (Based on User Demand)
- Multi-party trades (trade chains)
- Advanced search (BGG collection import)
- Email digest improvements
- Mobile app (PWA or native)
- Payment integration (Stripe for sales)

---

## 🚧 Critical Decisions Needed Before Week 2

### Decision 1: Rating System Type
**Options:**
- A) Thumbs up/down (simpler, less gameable)
- B) 1-5 stars (more granular, standard)

**Recommendation:** Thumbs up/down for MVP (matches PRD), add stars later if needed

### Decision 2: Vouch Eligibility
**Options:**
- A) Anyone can vouch anyone (trust community)
- B) Require 1 completed trade to vouch (prevent spam)
- C) Require phone verification OR 1 vouch received (matches docs)

**Recommendation:** Option B for MVP (simplest), add Option C when phone verification ready

### Decision 3: Trade Cancellation
**Options:**
- A) Either party can cancel anytime before 'shipped'
- B) Only initiator can cancel in first 24h
- C) Both must agree to cancel

**Recommendation:** Option A for MVP (keeps listings moving), add cancellation reason field

### Decision 4: Dispute Handling
**Options:**
- A) Dispute = flag for manual review, trade stays in limbo
- B) Dispute = auto-rollback, listing goes back to active
- C) Dispute = mediator assigned (future feature)

**Recommendation:** Option A for MVP, build proper dispute system post-launch

## 📦 Implementation Notes

### Architecture Choices (Already Decided)
- ✅ Client-side SPA (no SSR) - confirmed in recent merge
- ✅ PocketBase for all data operations - working well
- ✅ Svelte 5 runes everywhere - migration complete
- ✅ All routes use `+page.ts` loaders (no `+page.server.ts`)

### Code Organization

├── TrustBadge.svelte          # NEW - Trust tier badge
└── (existing components work as-is)
```

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing during development (use two browser sessions)
- Write unit tests for trust tier calculations
- E2E test for complete trade flow (Playwright)
- Beta test with 10-20 real users before public launch

### Performance Considerations
- All queries must be indexed (already done in schema)
- Use pagination everywhere (max 50 items per page)
- Optimize images (already using PocketBase thumbs)
- Lazy load trade history (infinite scroll)

## ⚠️ Known Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Users bypass trade system | Medium | Medium | Make trade flow rewarding (vouches); informal trades don't count toward reputation |
| Spam vouches/reviews | Low | High | Require completed trades; rate limiting (max 1 vouch per user) |
| Trade disputes escalate | Medium | Medium | Clear dispute button; build proper resolution system in Week 4 |
| Performance with many trades | Low | Medium | Indexed queries; pagination; tested with 1000+ records |
| Mobile UX issues | Low | Medium | Test on real devices; responsive design from day 1 |
