# Meeple Cart Developer Docs

Welcome to the Meeple Cart documentation hub. The goal of these pages is to capture shared knowledge that helps engineers bootstrap their local environment, understand the domain, and extend the product safely.

- Start with the [getting started guide](development/getting-started.md) for local setup tips and workflows.
- Review the [PocketBase data model reference](development/data-models.md) when working on backend features.
- Learn how the community gifting system works in the [trade chains overview](trade-chains.md).
- Understand reputation signals in the [trust & vouching guide](trust-and-vouches.md).

Documentation lives alongside the codebase so that it can evolve in sync with product changes. Feel free to suggest edits or add new pages as the architecture grows.
