## Remaining Feature: Multi-Listings

### Current State

Currently, the create listing form only allows adding **1 game per listing**. Users cannot:

- Add multiple games when creating a listing
- Add games to existing listings after creation
- Remove games from listings
- Edit game details (other than prices)

### What Needs to be Built

#### 1. Multi-Game Create Form

**File:** `src/routes/listings/new/+page.svelte`

**Changes needed:**

- Add "Add another game" button
- Dynamic array of game entries (client-side state)
- Each game has: title, condition, price, trade_value, notes, bgg_id
- "Remove game" button for each entry (except first)
- Form validation for each game
- Photo upload stays at listing level

**Implementation approach:**

```svelte
<script>
  let games = [
    {
      title: '',
      condition: 'excellent',
      price: '',
      trade_value: '',
      notes: '',
      bgg_id: '',
    },
  ];

  function addGame() {
    games = [
      ...games,
      {
        /* defaults */
      },
    ];
  }

  function removeGame(index) {
    games = games.filter((_, i) => i !== index);
  }
</script>
```

**Server changes:**
**File:** `src/routes/listings/new/+page.server.ts`

- Parse multiple games from form data
- Validate each game individually
- Create listing first
- Create multiple game records in a transaction/loop
- If any game creation fails, rollback (already has this pattern)
- Initialize price_history for each game

**Form data format:**

```
game_0_title=Catan
game_0_condition=excellent
game_0_price=50
game_1_title=Ticket to Ride
game_1_condition=good
game_1_price=40
```

#### 2. Listing Games Management Page

**New files:**

- `src/routes/listings/[id]/manage/+page.server.ts`
- `src/routes/listings/[id]/manage/+page.svelte`

**Features:**

- List all games in the listing
- Add new games to existing listing
- Edit game details (title, condition, notes, bgg_id)
- Remove games from listing
- Update game status (available/pending/sold/bundled)
- Owner-only access (like edit page)

**Server actions:**

```typescript
export const actions: Actions = {
  add_game: async ({ locals, params, request }) => {
    // Create new game record for this listing
  },

  update_game: async ({ locals, params, request }) => {
    // Update game details (not price - use edit page for that)
  },

  remove_game: async ({ locals, params, request }) => {
    // Delete game record
    // Maybe prevent if it's the last game?
  },

  update_status: async ({ locals, params, request }) => {
    // Update game status (mark as sold, etc.)
  },
};
```

**UI approach:**

- Table/list view of all games
- Inline editing or modal forms
- Confirm dialog for deletions
- Link from profile page: "Manage games" next to "Edit prices"

#### 3. Profile Page Updates

**File:** `src/routes/profile/+page.svelte`

Add "Manage games" link next to existing "Edit prices" link:

```svelte
<a href={`/listings/${listing.id}/manage`}> Manage games </a>
```

### Implementation Order

1. **Multi-game create form** (highest value)
   - Update UI for dynamic game entries
   - Update server to handle multiple games
   - Test with 1, 2, 5 games

2. **Games management page** (nice to have)
   - Create manage page routes
   - Build CRUD operations for games
   - Add navigation links

3. **Edge cases** (polish)
   - Prevent deleting last game in listing
   - Validate at least 1 game on create
   - Handle form validation for all games
   - Price history initialization for new games

### Technical Considerations

**Client-side state management:**

- Use reactive Svelte arrays for game list
- Each game gets unique index/key
- Preserve field values when adding/removing

**Server-side validation:**

- Validate each game independently
- Return field errors with game index (e.g., `game_0_title`)
- Aggregate errors for display

**Database transactions:**

- Consider wrapping multiple game creates in try/catch
- Rollback listing if any game fails
- Already have this pattern for single game

**Price tracking:**

- Initialize price_history for all games on create
- When adding games to existing listing, initialize their price_history too

**Form UX:**

- Auto-scroll to newly added game
- Focus title input on add
- Collapse/expand game sections?
- Show game count in submit button ("Create listing with 3 games")

## Next Steps

To continue with multi-listings:

1. Start with `src/routes/listings/new/+page.svelte`
2. Add client-side state for multiple games
3. Build dynamic UI (add/remove game sections)
4. Update `src/routes/listings/new/+page.server.ts`
5. Parse and create multiple games
6. Test thoroughly
7. Consider building management page or commit as-is

**Recommendation:** Start simple with just the create form enhancement. The management page can be added later as a separate feature.

## Key Patterns Established

**Price tracking:**

- All prices have history initialized on create
- `getLowestHistoricalPrice()` prevents gaming
- 3-day threshold before showing drops

**Notifications:**

- Users watch listings, get notified on price drops
- Digest frequency options (instant/daily/weekly)
- Non-blocking notification creation

**Search:**

- Use relation queries: `games_via_listing.field`
- Sanitize input: `value.replace(/"/g, '\\"')`
- Multiple filters with AND logic

**Profile trust:**

- Public profiles show trade history
- Vouches build reputation
- Transparent stats (trade count, vouch count)
