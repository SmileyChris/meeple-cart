# Product Requirements Document: Meeple Cart

## Board Game Trading Platform for New Zealand

### Executive Summary

Meeple Cart is a dedicated web platform enabling New Zealand's board gaming community to trade, sell, and acquire board games without relying on Facebook. The platform addresses the fragmentation and limitations of existing solutions while building on established community behaviors and trust patterns.

## Problem Statement

### Current State

10,000+ New Zealand board gamers currently coordinate trades through a Facebook group ("Buy, Sell and Trade Boardgames NZ"), facing significant friction:

**Platform Limitations:**

- Facebook Marketplace not optimized for collectibles/hobbies
- No game-specific features (condition grading, BGG integration)
- Poor search and filtering capabilities
- Clunky bulk listing process
- Lost listings in social media feeds
- Facebook account requirement excludes some community members

**Trust & Safety Challenges:**

- No specialized reputation system for traders
- Difficult to verify trading history
- No structured way to build community trust
- Limited visibility into mutual connections

**Process Inefficiencies:**

- Manual cross-referencing with BoardGameGeek
- Repetitive data entry for collections
- No automated matching for wants/trades
- Coordination happens across multiple channels (comments, DMs, texts)

### Opportunity

Create a purpose-built platform that reduces friction in the game trading process while strengthening community bonds and trust mechanisms specific to the NZ board gaming community's needs.

## UX Flow Sketches

### Flow: Create Want-to-Buy Listing

1. User selects `Create Listing` from dashboard and chooses the `Want to Buy` tab.
2. User searches BoardGameGeek catalog or enters manual game details.
3. User sets desired condition range, offer price or trade preference, and optional notes.
4. Flow defaults to the `Private` state so the user can review before publishing.
5. User previews the request, toggles notifications for seller responses, then publishes to move the listing into the `Listed` state.
6. Confirmation screen reinforces where the want-to-buy post appears and how sellers can respond.

### Flow: Manage Listing State Lifecycle

1. From the `My Listings` dashboard, user sees grouped cards by state (`Private`, `Listed`, `Pending`, `Sold`).
2. User can edit a `Private` listing and choose `Publish`, triggering validation before transitioning to `Listed`.
3. When a trade conversation reaches agreement, user taps `Mark as Pending`; the system logs timestamp and surfaces fulfillment checklist.
4. After completion, user selects `Mark as Sold`, adds optional buyer feedback, and the listing archives to the `Sold` bucket while remaining visible in trade history.
5. At any stage, user can revert to `Private` (draft) or back to `Listed`, with a visible state history timeline for context.

### Flow: Respond to a Want-to-Buy Request

1. Seller browses the `Want to Buy` view or receives a saved-search alert about a matching request.
2. Seller opens the request, reviews desired price/condition, and taps `Offer Game`.
3. Seller selects an existing `Private` or `Listed` game from their library or creates a quick listing inline.
4. Seller sends an offer message; system links the offer to both the seller's listing and the buyer's request.
5. Buyer reviews the offer within the request thread, can accept to create a `Pending` trade, counter with adjustments, or decline.

### Flow: Highlight External Deals (Future)

1. System ingests daily feeds from partner NZ retailers and Amazon, normalizes titles, and flags matches to tracked games.
2. Deals landing page groups offers by retailer and popularity, with filters for price drop percentage and location.
3. Users subscribe to deal alerts per game; when a new deal surfaces, they receive notifications with direct links and community commentary prompts.
4. Users can bookmark deals to compare against trade offers or convert them into want-to-buy posts when the sale matches their criteria.
