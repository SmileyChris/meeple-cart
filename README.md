# Meeple Cart

> A dedicated board game trading platform for Aotearoa's board gaming community

**Status:** 70% Complete - Core infrastructure done, trade workflow in progress
**Version:** 0.0.1 (Pre-MVP)
**Target Launch:** 3 weeks

---

## 🎯 What is Meeple Cart?

Meeple Cart enables New Zealand's 10,000+ board gamers to trade, sell, and acquire games without relying on Facebook. The platform provides:

- **Multi-game listings** with condition grading & BGG integration
- **Formal trade workflow** with status tracking & completion verification
- **Trust system** with vouches, ratings, and reputation tiers
- **Private messaging** per listing with notifications
- **Gift cascades** - community game giveaway system
- **Watchlist & search** for discovering games

**Why?** Facebook Marketplace lacks hobby-specific features (condition grading, trade facilitation, trust building) and the community wants a dedicated home.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Just command runner (optional but recommended)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd meeple

# One command to rule them all
just dev
```

The `just dev` recipe handles everything:
- ✅ Installs npm dependencies
- ✅ Creates `.env` from template
- ✅ Downloads PocketBase binary
- ✅ Applies database migrations
- ✅ Starts PocketBase server (http://127.0.0.1:8090)
- ✅ Starts SvelteKit dev server (http://127.0.0.1:5173)

**First run?** Wait ~30 seconds for migrations to complete, then visit http://127.0.0.1:5173

---

## 📋 Project Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented (Ready to Use)

- **Authentication** - Register/login via PocketBase
- **Listing Management** - Create/edit multi-game listings (trade/sell/want)
- **Messaging** - Private threads per listing with notifications
- **Gift Cascades** - Complete lifecycle (create → enter → select winner → track)
- **User Profiles** - Public profiles with stats
- **Notifications** - In-app center + email digests
- **Watchlist** - Save favorite listings
- **Theme Toggle** - Dark/light mode
- **Database Schema** - 11 collections, fully migrated

### 🚧 In Progress (Blocking MVP)

- **Trade Workflow** - Can message but can't formalize trades (UI exists but incomplete)
- **Feedback System** - Database ready, UI missing
- **Vouch System** - Partially wired, needs completion
- **Browse/Search** - Removed during merge, needs client-side rebuild
- **Trust Tiers** - Logic exists but not displayed

### 📅 Coming Next (3-Week Plan)

See **[MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** for detailed roadmap.

**Week 1:** Complete trade workflow (initiate → confirm → complete)
**Week 2:** Feedback & trust system (ratings, reviews, vouches)
**Week 3:** Browse/search pages + launch prep
